    Q)How do I approach designing software?

    A)I approach each project differently. For example if I am creating a project from scratch, I first analyze the system requirements and/ or client requirements.
      However, if I am approaching a program that is either in progress or is to be updated/ modified, I begin by walking the provided code and comparing this to the
      system requirements and software constraints. Each project requires an adaptive and responsive approach.

        Q)What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

        A)I have developed new skills in the area of computational graphics. Additionally, I gained insight into the differences in CPU vs GPU data processing.

        Q)What design process did you follow for your project work?

        A)I followed the first process described above. I looked at the design requirements and analyzed the key details required of my program.
          Next I worked to condense my program and ensure that there was a logical order to my code. This was to allow anyone reviewing the program
          to understand my data flow and process. Additionally, as I generally make a rule to ensure proper whitespacing and documentation, I 
          made sure to follow these philosophies.

        Q)How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

        A)I believe that all of the tactics from my approach this round, can be applied to my future projects. While they may not be followed
          exactly, they can be adapted to suit the needs of the current project.

    Q)How do I approach developing programs?

    A)I first go over the details in my head, ensuring that I understand the requirements and begin to follow the logical flows.
      My next step is to sketch out my processes and data flows, and how these relate to the requirements. Additionally, I will
      Write out any constraints that may inhibit certain functionality.

        Q)What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

        A)I had to develope new strategies on how my program was organized in terms of data flow, as the graphics rendering process
          does not follow the typical CPU sided data flow conventions.

        Q)How did iteration factor into your development?

        A)I used an iterative process to work through each added functionality and implementation. Also, I used an iterative process as a whole
          while working to clean up my code and ensure proper coding practices.

        Q)How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

        A)In terms of CPU vs GPU programing, I had to change a lot of my past habits. I also had to change my vision of how my overall program composition
          structure begins. Again, implementing an iterative process was key to adapting to the challenges set before me.

    Q)How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

    A)I have always been fascinated by software and computer science. I find the intrigue and puzzling nature to be exciting. I have been told that "I light up with
      excitement" when I discuss what I am working on. Computer science will lead me to unexpected adventures and interesting puzzles. I hope to be able to 
      contribute in a meaningful way as I progress through my lifelong journey with computer science.

        Q)How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

        A)I definitely was able to hone my skills in iterative processes as well as new understanding of how data flows through a computational system.
          These skills and insight will help to ensure my success in the future.

        Q)How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

        A)As I hope to work in the video game industry at some point in my career as well as 3D graphics, the skills gained in this course help to 
          build a strong foundation in my future journey in post-academic life.
